# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: Nov 20th 2023**

This Privacy Policy outlines the data processing practices conducted through the Discord Bot named Bobux Bot, owned by Exenifix (referred to as the "Bot"). For any inquiries regarding your personal information or questions concerning these practices, please contact us at exenifix@gmail.com.

## Definitions

- **Personal Information:** Refers to information about an identified or identifiable natural person.
- **Usage Data:** Denotes usage data of commands and other information processed by the Bot, depersonalized, and aggregated for statistical purposes.
- **Owner:** The head maintainer of the project.
- **Bot:** An application on the Discord platform capable of interacting with the platform via API, owned by the Owner.

## Data Usage

The Bot processes the following data about its users:

1. Discord User and Guild IDs.
2. Guild Invites.
3. Usage Data.

This data is processed for the following purposes:

1. Ensuring the proper functioning of the Bot.
2. Improving the Bot's features and services.
3. Generating aggregated, depersonalized statistics about the Bot's usage.

The Bot processes Personal Information on the legal basis of consent. By using the Bot, you agree to the processing of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

The Owner may disclose your Personal Information to third parties only in the following cases:

1. To comply with legal obligations.
2. To enforce or apply the Bot's terms of use.
3. To protect the rights, property, or safety of the Bot, its users, or others.

### Guild Invites

Upon joining, the Bot creates an invite and stores it in an internal database mapped to the guild ID. This invite can be used by Bot developers to join the server and gather feedback. Users can opt out by denying the "Create Invites" permission to the Bot upon joining or by revoking the created invite via server settings. The Bot does not recreate invites once revoked.

The Bot stores all Personal Information securely, restricting access by third parties. Data connected to a user's Discord ID will be retained as long as the user uses the Bot but may be deleted without consent after 60 days of inactivity.

If you wish to have your data removed, please contact us at exenifix@gmail.com.

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, and the latest version will always be available on this page.
